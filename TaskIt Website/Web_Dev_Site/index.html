					<h3>The Restaurant</h3>
					<p>Cafe Vincz&eacute; is a casual fine dining restaurant, offering warm hospitality in a rustic historically preserved building. A high, open beam ceiling, exposed brick and concrete floors display the original space, while an open kitchen, banquette seating and gentle lighting contribute to an intimate and contemporary feel.</p>
